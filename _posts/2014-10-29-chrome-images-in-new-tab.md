Image above this post is satellite image of Kimbolton, Australia. A good friend recommended me [Earth View From Google Maps](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/earth-view-from-google-ma/bhloflhklmhfpedakmangadcdofhnnoh/related) chrome extension. It's so good I had to let the world know. It shows me a new satellite image of real world places each time I open a new tab.

Here are some other images it showed me:

###Twist, Germany

You should try it out. It's one of best extensions I have come across. 

Oh and [Lastpass](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/lastpass-free-password-ma/hdokiejnpimakedhajhdlcegeplioahd) is also one great extension I can't live without.
