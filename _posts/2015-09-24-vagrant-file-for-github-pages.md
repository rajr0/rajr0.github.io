title: Vagrant file for github pages
---

Vagrant makes life easier and keeps your machine clean. I have made a vagrant file for github pages and am sharing it here so you don't have to scratch head and says some nasty things to ruby and gems as I did.

Copy files [Vagrantfile](/Vagrantfile) and [provisioner](/provisioner) in your github.io blog root and run `vagrant up`, sit back and relax. See your blog served at [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000) at the end of provision.

[Create issue](https://github.com/haisum/haisum.github.io/issues) if it breaks.
