title: Learning Scala
---

I am learning scala from coursera course [Functional Programming Principles in Scala](https://www.coursera.org/course/progfun). Will add updates here as I proceed. For now, it seems quite interesting, it revised my recursion and made me better at writing functions. I am also following the book [Programming in Scala](http://www.chegg.com/textbooks/programming-in-scala-2nd-edition-9780981531649-0981531644?trackid=DyU6cYHw&strackid=nTm4A6cq&ii=1&om_ss=1). Go get it or join the course, functional programming is in buzz today so better learn it and add one more skill to your resume.
