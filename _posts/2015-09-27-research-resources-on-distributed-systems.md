title: Collection of papers, lectures and readings on distributed systems
---

Ever since I graduated, I have been very very interested in building distributed fault tolerant systems and I read a lot about them. In my part time, I also work on some hobby projects to get better understanding of modern distributed systems. Over the time, I have made a good collection of useful resources such as papers, lectures and other readings. Here's my collection on distributed systems shared with public via Google drive. Hope it helps someone interested in or working on distributed systems.
