I love what I do. I also love all people who do what I do. I mean look at all wonders IT has done in few decades. Which other discipline changed the world so much for good than IT in such small time? Not only has IT helped on its own, it has helped other engineering and scientific disciplines in solving problems and seeing possibilities which were never imaginable before. Movies can have realistic special affects thanks to CGI by placing simple green scenes behind actors as compared to earlier hardwork of creating complex sets. Architects can precisely design complex structures using CAD tools which would otherwise be impossible or very very hard to get right. Genetic Engineering in biology would be impossible without aid from IT. Simulations of physical phenomenon and processing of thousands of images captured by hubble are achievements of field I fortunately belong to. All these problems are solved by programmers, sometimes you see their effort, sometimes they program so well and neat that it's almost invisible to you, but somewhere in some cubicle a geek is working at least 40 hours a week to make your life easier and making this world a better place.

Huge portfolio of achievements and feeling of creating things those never existed by using just a keyboard and computer are enough reasons to love what I do. But there's more to programming than I just mentioned. Above all is the culture of programmers and programming community. Outsiders who don't know this field deeply would wonder how come IT has achieved so much in such a little time. All credit goes to the culture of programming community. If human beings and other fields of education embaraced the culture of programming or hacker community we would see a drastically better world. Let's see what I am talking about.
